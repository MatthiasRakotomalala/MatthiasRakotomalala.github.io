I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich, affiliated with the Chair of Analysis and Modelling (Prof. [Johannes Zimmer](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/math/personen/professuren/zimmer-johannes/)). I defended my PhD in Applied Mathematics on September 3, 2025, at École polytechnique (CMAP), under the supervision of Dr. [Charles Bertucci](https://charles-bertucci.github.io/) (Chargé de recherche, CNRS).
My thesis, <i><u>On some systems of partial differential equations of the mean-field type</u></i>, is available [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-05309579v1).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the analysis of partial differential (PDE) equations and stochastic differential equations. It orbits around understanding the emergence of collective behaviors in mean-field models of large populations of interacting agents or particles, with applications in biology, economics, and physics.

*Monte Carlo particle simulations of the model introduced in [3](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218202525500496), motivated by collective ant behavior. Orange arrows represent ants, and the concentration of pheromones is shown in blue.*
