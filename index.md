I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich, affiliated with the Chair of Analysis and Modelling (Prof. Johannes Zimmer). I defended my PhD in Applied Mathematics on September 3, 2025, at École polytechnique (CMAP), under the supervision of Dr. Charles Bertucci (Chargé de recherche, CNRS).
My thesis, On some systems of partial differential equations of the mean-field type, is available here.
